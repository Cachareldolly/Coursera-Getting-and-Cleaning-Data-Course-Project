# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This is the project of the Getting and Cleaning Data of Coursera. 

This project analyses the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.

This datasets are experiments that have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope.


In this Repo you can find:

1.- The tidy data set.

2.- A Code Book that indicates the variables and summaries calculated, along with units.

3.- the R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

  Merge the trining and the test sets to create one data set.

  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

  Appropiately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

  From the dataset in the previous step, creates a second independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
